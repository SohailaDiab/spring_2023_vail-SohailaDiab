## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
### Convolutional Neural Networks
- An artificial neural network that is popularly used for analyzing images. They can be used for other data analysis or classification problems too.
- It is an ANN that is able to detect patterns and make sense of them. This pattern detection makes CNN useful for image analysis.

### What differentiates CNN from a standard Multilayer Perception (MLP)?
- CNN has hidden layers called **Convolutional Layers**. They can and usually do have other non-convolutional layers as well, but the basis of the CNNs is the convolutional layers.

### What do the convolutional layers do?
